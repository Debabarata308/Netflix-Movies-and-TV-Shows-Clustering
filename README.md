# Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Shows-Clustering
Netflix Movies &amp; TV Shows Clustering, we were able to analyse and perform an unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm for the unlabelled datasets. The dataset we were provided with contains several columns and other numerical features. We were also asked two questions that could be answered from EDA.  The EDA was done extensively as we needed to derive good insights to support our claim and hypothesis. We were able to answer the two questions that followed along with the EDA, country-wise trend analysis on content and genre; and also to analyse if Netflix was focusing more on Shows rather than Movies.  After we performed EDA, both univariate and bivariate analysis, we have prepared our text columns by following basic text cleaning, stopwords removal, tokenisation and stemming. After the text columns were ready, we selected only features or words that were important using TF IDF Vectorisation and also reduced dimension.
